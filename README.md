## Employee Retention: Providing data-driven suggestions for HR
### Background Salifort Motors
This project is to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

Salifortâ€™s senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company. Salifort strives to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. Further, the high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. Salifort makes a big investment in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees. As a first step, the leadership team asks Human Resources to survey a sample of employees to learn more about what might be driving turnover.
The dataset that will be using in this lab contains 15,000 rows and 10 columns for the variables .Dataset avaialble on Kaggle.
We used **PACE** workflow here to structure the analysis and modeling

### Process
## Plan Stage
#### Step 1. Imports
Import packages
Load dataset
#### Step 2. Data Exploration (Initial EDA and data cleaning)
Understand your variables
Clean dataset (missing data, redundant data, outliers)
## Analyse Stage
#### Step 3. Data Exploration 
EDA Continuation and Visualisation
## Construct Stage
#### Step 3. Model Building
Fit a model that predicts the outcome variable using two or more independent variables
Logistic Regression,Decision Trees and Random Forest
Check model assumptions
Evaluate the model
## Execute Stage
#### Step 4. Results and Evaluation
Interpret model
Evaluate model performance using metrics
Prepare results, visualizations, and actionable steps to share with stakeholders
